</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Here’s the scene: it’s heading towards midsem, you have assignments out your ears (and eyes, and nose…). Your mother is breathing down your neck because you haven't showered in days and your teeth feel faintly fuzzy; what’s worse is that you can't work up the motivation to do anything about anything.</p>
<p>Never fear, for there is an answer to these problems, and it’s an online RPG.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, what are you talking about?</strong></p>
<p>Habitica is an online game to help improve real life habits via gamification. We all know that instant gratification (with a dose of fun and novelty) is the best way to get ourselves into a habit, or to motivate ourselves to do something we don't want to. Habitica turns those icky tasks into little monsters to conquer (and reap the rewards from beating). The better you are at doing your things, the more you progress in the game (unlocking cool things and widening the world you can play in). If you slip up in real life, your character takes a hit in game too.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is gamified</strong></p>
<p>And I mean everything. Cleaning your teeth? I think you mean sharpening your fangs (what better way to show the world who is the fiercest hunter in the universe). Load of washing? Pfft, clearly you're making an offering to Charybdis (Cast your dirty outerwear into the Whirlpool of Washing Tonnes, and get it back with the dirt and grease thoroughly thrashed out of it!). Your thesis becomes the twelve labours of Heracles, your cleaning keeping the campsite free of wolves. Plus, in finishing your tasks you can level up, get gold, collect equipment, and find eggs to hatch into pets (then grow them into mounts). Just in case you wanted more of an incentive to get those dishes out of the sink!</p>
<p><strong>Plus, you get to battle monsters</strong></p>
<p>The game is really focused on working as a team, and as a team you get to do a bunch of cool quests. This team-based scenario has the bonus that if you slip, it hurts the team as well (an extra, extra incentive to do what needs to be done!). So far, I’ve killed a vicious conglomerate of lists, as well as ridding the shores of a lake of dirty dishes. I’m looking forward to hunting down a message in a bottle next… The flavourtext immerses you in the world, and the variety of quests offered really keeps you guessing.</p>
<p><a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/habitrpg/images/2/23/Quest_Basilist.png/revision/latest?cb=20141125010727 “There's a commotion in the marketplace—the kind that should make you run away. Being a courageous adventurer, you run towards it instead, and discover a Basi-list, coalescing from a clump of incomplete To-Dos! Nearby Habiticans are paralyzed with fear at the length of the Basi-list, unable to start working...”"></a></p>
<p><strong>Groups out the wazoo</strong></p>
<p>As well as your monster-battling team, there are a bunch of other interest groups you can join, plus an inn to chatter amongst yourselves. The environment is super friendly and supportive, and the mods are very present and super reasonable. Guilds are like special interest groups; there are ones for parents, writers, coders and highly stressed students to name a few. Sometimes they have special competitions within the group which allows you to win things (like gold or gems). They’re pretty great for motivation and for finding people with similar interests.</p>
<p>The tavern, too, is pretty fun; similar to an IRC channel it lets anyone in the game chat to anyone else. It’s markdown compliant if you want to super-format your posts, and a very friendly place to shoot the breeze with anyone who happens to drop by.</p>
<p><strong>Open source is best source</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the coolest thing so far about Habitica; if you’re keen to help out there’s almost certainly a place for you! Whether it’s pixel art, translation, or good old fashioned code, there’s a whole set of improvements and bugs to be jumping on. The main devs are really involved, both on the development side and the social(media) side. They even responded to my excited tweet recently! Plus, if you do contribute in a meaningful way, there’s a special badge that only devs can get. Added, added bonus!</p>
<p>So in short, find a waterfall, shine those fangs and get adventuring, because doing what you must has never been so fun.</p>
