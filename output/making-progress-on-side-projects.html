</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Side projects are a potentially useful tool for a variety of ends; raising profile, learning things that you’re interested in but aren’t necessarily covering in class or at work, spending time on something you control and thus helping to manage burnout. That’s not to say that projects are for everyone (I know people who would much rather work on something non computing related in their off hours, and if that's what works for them then thats awesome too). </p>
<p>But, if there is something that you really want to build, or write about, or anything, it is possible without overbalancing your carefully planned work-life-sleep-study tightrope. This is how I manage to not fall over with projects in progress.</p>
<p><strong>1. Schedule</strong></p>
<p>Before you run off screaming about the HSC, I’m not advocating planning your day down to the last minute. With larger projects, or writing pieces, possession of a ‘stockpile’ of work, ready to be released at a later date, can be really useful. People tend to be interested in ongoing, often updated projects; sadly life seems to conspire to make regular updates an impossibility. A stockpile of work helps to mitigate this, and makes for a smoother running of the project.</p>
<p>The other benefit of this is that it prompts regular thinking about the project you’re working on. This can be more important than the physical act of coding/writing/building itself, as it allows you to revisit ideas multiple times. The thought of background music on your website may have seemed like a great idea at the time, but looking back on it hopefully you’ll see the error of your ways (if not, then I’m afraid we can’t be friends).</p>
<p><strong>2. Lists</strong></p>
<p>Oh the beauty of a well written list! There is an enormous difference between a TODO list that consists of “write project, write tests” and a TODO list that contains elements like “change colour of x, add section for y” (hint, the latter is better). Making lists that are broken down into teensy segments makes them much more accessible, so you're more likely to get back into working on a project if you have a spare minute between study and work.</p>
<p>Breaking these lists into projects is really helpful as well. As the time between working on them grows, its easy to forget exactly which project each is related to. Changing the text on that super professional site to fuschia, rather than navy, is probably not the best way to get back into projects. </p>
<p>The hardest thing about good lists is accepting that you need to document every little detail of the project. When you’re absorbed in it, you’re convinced that you’ll remember it all the next time you come back. You won't. </p>
<p><strong>3. Post Small, Post Often</strong></p>
<p>One thing I know from experience, and from friends’ experience, is that people are often wary of launching half finished thoughts to the world. If you’re building missile detection systems or hospital equipment, I can see how that would be a problem, but for side projects it's much more okay to chill and ship where you’re at.</p>
<p>Share, get feedback, change ideas and get something totally different from what you set out doing. If you’ve learnt something new, or made something, then put it out there. Outside a uni environment, people don't really care that it lacks appropriate unit tests, or that there’s a strange bug in the GUI that turns everything upside down 2% of the time. </p>
<p>Hiding your ideas from other people strangles them, and nobody benefits. Letting them be tested as you go and exposed to outside influences can produce something awesome.</p>
<p><strong>4. One by One (Two by Two)</strong></p>
<p>I find that inspiration is an incredibly effective procrastination technique. There’s nothing wrong with being inspired, and wanting to build things (in fact I'd hazard to say its a good thing), but it's better to be working on two side projects than twenty. </p>
<p>If inspiration strikes and your project time is maxed out, then write it down. Write everything down, and store it away, and come back to it later. If it's still awesome and exciting then, then add it to your list and build it. Otherwise, you haven't lost anything from not building it and another idea will come along which may grab your attention more.</p>
<p>The hardest part is finishing a project. Finishing doesn't mean launching, necessarily, but getting what you wanted from the project. If you wanted to see if you could do unnatural things to bmp images and you found that you could, then you're a strange person but good on you. Once you’re ready to focus on something else, then head off on your next adventure. </p>
<p>It’s your project, you can define what finished means.</p>
<p><strong>5. Strategic Sundays</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, there are elements of a TODO list that are a bit larger or more complex than the rest, sometimes you just want a bit of a break from uni work and to sink your teeth into something different. This sort of thing required a block of time that you can devote totally to the pursuit of a project; weekends are perfect for this. </p>
<p>This isn’t to say that every weekend needs to be devoted to a project (remember, this is about fitting them into your life, not fitting your life around them)! It does mean that you can end the weekend with something substantial to show for it, and the sense that you’ve used your time well.</p>
