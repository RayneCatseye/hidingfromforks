Title: The Trouble With Tshirts

Understanding typical culture in computer science faculties, as well as tech companies, can be difficult for those who haven’t been exposed to the environment. The best analogy I've come across is to pretend you're a really geeky 8 – 12 year old boy. What sort of things to geeky boys like? 
- Computers
- Caffeine
- Video games
- Junk food
- Scooters
- Bean bag chairs
And just like this, you’re three quarters of the way to what the CSE basement wants to be, and almost the whole way to a real life tech startup.

**So where do t-shirts fit?**

T-Shirts are an integral to the computing culture, and have been for as long as the culture tore itself away from maths and science. From coolness ratings to social cohesion, t-shirts have evolved with computing to become one of the hallmarks of the field; we don't get Obama allowing anyone else to dress like children at work.

*Incentives*
When push comes to shove, there are some things that matter more than money (sorry finance students!). Even money itself means different things when presented in a different way: for example, the $200 worth of bread needed to cover main walkway with toast is perceived as having a totally different value to a new set of $200 headphones (and let me tell you, one of these things is more fun). If you’ve nabbed an internship with a cool company, or you’ve been working really hard on a project which has come out awesome, a t-shirt is a better prize to show off that hard work than a monetary bonus. Money goes, tshirts persist until they fall apart in the wash. And trust me, I’ve seen some legacy shirts walking around; they'll last longer than any bonus ever would. 

*Cohesion*
Have you ever noticed, walking around the basement, that there are t-shirt themes from time to time? And have you noticed that everyone seems super pleased that they're one of the matching ones? There’s a reason for this, and that reason is cohesion. 

In comp, t-shirts play a similar role to suits in the corporate world; they allow everyone to feel a part of something larger than themselves, an elite “family”. Heading into tech, one of the first things I did was to attend a series of events and grab t-shirts at every opportunity I could (yeah, I know, I had my priorities straight). It made a real impact on how I saw myself (I was one of the cool kids then), and even the way people treated me. When I was swanning around in dresses, nobody batted an eye, but put me in a t-shirt and suddenly people were asking me questions like I knew what I was talking about. Id become part of the group, and because I’d done this so fast, people assumed that Id been there for ages!

As well as creating a sense of cohesion, people genuinely enjoy wearing their favourite “brands”. Tech people are lucky insofar that brands also want us to wear (and promote) them. Choice in tshirts showcases what you're interested in, and lets you find similarly minded people without too much effort. It's far easier than rebooting your phone every five minutes to show Cyanogenmod’s boot screen, and doesn’t die as fast as stickers (bonus: tshirts are more practical than either of these).

*Rewards for Merit* 
Computing as a field has a greater focus on merit than pretty much any other walk of life. Side projects, repo commits and work projects all contribute to seniority (and hireability), as well as to knowledge. One way that this is reinforced is via “reward” tshirts. 

Did you get into that summer camp in 2013? Have a t-shirt; we redesign them every year. Make it as an intern in 2012? There’s a special shirt for that too. In a socially acceptable, non (overtly) bragging way, t-shirts communicate a form of reward that is structured and “fair”; you work, you're rewarded. Easy. 

*Empowerment* 
You may think it strange that I put this last in the list of reasons, as it’s a pretty universal one. Its very true that everyone wants to be empowered, but the way that t-shirts empower people in the workplace is much more marked than the way it empowers us at uni (protip: in most jobs it isn't okay to wear t-shirts to work). 

When you get down to it, t-shirts are the universal yardstick for how switched on a company is and how in tune they are with their employees. Not having a strict dress code tends to reflect a wider environment of flexibility and a focus on product, not presentation. Most major companies (Google, Facebook etc) in the field actively encourage that level of dress, and reinforce it with company tshirts (its self fulfilling like that). 


Ultimately, t-shirts are like medals for us nerds; we get a sense of cohesion with our fellow coders, we get rewarded for doing cool things, and we don't have to wear suits. So next time you do a cool thing, grab a t-shirt on your way out and wear it with pride. There’s a good chance the rest of us are staring at you enviously.
