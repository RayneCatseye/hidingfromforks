Sometimes, I do things. Sometimes this doing of things manifests itself in weird and wonderful ways, such as writing a myriad of puzzles all in one go, and foisting them on some poor, unsuspecting soul to deal with.

This year, I wrote many, many puzzles for Beta, the CSE Student magazine run by my longsuffering friend Jashank.Some of these puzzles were pretty good, too, if I can say so myself.

Bonus: There was a "best of" article published at the end of the year, and it was mine \*sniff\*. It was also one of the [most fun articles I've written so far](static/BestOf.pdf)!

Looking forward to next year, when I can again dominate the uni newsletter, and ~~brainwash the masses~~ tell eveveryone about how wonderful everything is.
