Winter, as I suspect you know, is cold, and it’s looking to be a damn cold winter this winter. So what best to help keep you warm on a cold, blustery day, than staying nice and warm in bed, watching youtube vids and ignoring parents.

To facilitate maximum levels of staying-in-bed and telling your parents that you are, in fact, doing uni-related “work”, I present here a list of must-watch videos ranging from dawn-of-the-internet speculative pieces, to documentaries showing current-day reality. Feel free to skip the ones that don't catch your interest, there’s lots more to see, and many more winters to come. Happy watching!

**1. Citizenfour**
A very pertinent documentary in light of recent Australian and international laws, we (through the lens of Laura Poitras) follow Edward Snowden as he releases to the world the extent of the spying going on behind our backs. Filmed live, as proceedings were ongoing, it makes for a compelling watch, if only to watch how genuinely Snowden responds to what is happening around (and because of) him.  "We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind."

**2. The Internet’s Own Boy**
This documentary, unlike all the others listed, is about a person rather than a movement or an idea. Developer of the RSS feed, and founder of Reddit, Aaron Swartz’s foray into politics led to a massive legal struggle which culminated in him taking his own life 2 years ago. Framed against a backdrop of ever increasing control on internet rights, as well as civil liberties, it’s a powerful piece of media, and a very recommended watch.

**3. Revolution OS**
A documentary looking at the people, and their rationales, backing the open source movement. With such interviewees as Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds, and covering 20+ years, it's an interesting watch. Bonus points because of the animosity between people in the movement (Linus and Richard, I’m looking at you). As Linus said, “Think of Richard Stallman as the great philosopher and think of me as the engineer.” Because credit is meant to be shared. (Those interested in computing culture, here’s where a lot of it began.)

**4. The DEFCON Documentary**
UNSW sends teams off to the DEFCON CTF (Capture the Flag) to fight for victory almost every year. In terms of the SecEng world, DEFCON is a realm unto itself. This documentary talks about the origins of DEFCON, as well as how things have grown into what they are today (plus it’s pretty hilarious to boot). If you're looking for lectures or a how-to-hack, this isn’t your jam, but if you're interested in the people and culture surrounding the hackosphere, and what the hell goes on at DEFCON, we have you covered.

**5. Hyperland**
Douglas Adams narrates (and stars in!) this blast to the past, dreaming about a future where people play a more active role in the information they digest (hmm, now what does that sound like…). With Tom Baker as his guide, he dreams a dream about what we now call the internet. Part historical documentary, part exploration of (then) current knowledge, it’s altogether engaging.

**6. Primer**
Expect to watch this movie more than once. Made on a shoestring budget, and not skimping on the technobabble, this is a film for a day you can appreciate it. Our basic premise is time travel, but the direction taken is entirely unexpected. Thoroughly recommended.

**7. Hackers**
Oh Hackers, how can I describe thee. Quintessentially 90s, horrifyingly inaccurate, yet strangely compelling. This movie shows us the programmers we wish we could be, in the fashion we wish we could forget.
