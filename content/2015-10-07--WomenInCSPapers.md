As you’ve probably heard somewhere (on the news, friends talking, people yelling with loudspeakers, internet blogs, Reddit), computer science (CS) has a bit of a problem with women, or, as some outspoken people like to call it, “a leaky pipeline”. 

This pipeline is meant to ferry women from conception, all the way through to becoming CEOs in the tech industry, or something to that effect.

Unfortunately, it seems to have sprung a few leaks somewhere in the 1980s and rather than remaining a consistent diameter, it seems to dramatically narrow as women age. Bummer. 

Fortunately, we have some handy plumbers on hand who are trying to staunch the flow of women into other fields, and work out why they’re leaving the pipeline in the first place. This article covers a few of the papers in the field that assess what the issues are, and what can be done about it (and unlike this introduction, they’re deadly serious about this).


**Why are There so Few Female Computer Scientists? - Ellen Spertus**

This paper is an oldie (from 1991!) but a goodie. Its also enormous, coming in at 111 pages, so it's not for the faint of heart. What it does do is systematically dissect all the issues, social and otherwise, that affect women at all stages of “the pipeline”; that oft-favoured phrase which makes it sound like all we need is a good plumber.

The report covers five main areas:

1. Societal pressure against women being successful
2. Ways in which male-dominated environments discourage women
3. Inequalities in language (cause and effect)
4. Negative consequences of some attempts to help women
5. Recommendations (and Conclusions, not necessarily in that order)

If you're looking for a paper which will tell you “don't do this thing because it's problematic”, then this is your document. It covers an enormous range of things, in substantial detail, and when people ask for recommendations on designing more female friendly courses, I invariably refer back to this report in giving them suggestions. I’d recommend this to everyone in or around engineering as a whole, as I suspect that many of these issues are more widespread than CS alone.

**Encouraging Women in Computer Science - Eric S. Roberts, Marina Kassianidou, Lilly Irani**

I like this paper primarily because it’s based on what a university (Stanford) has actually done, and the actual results these changes have led to. It has shiny graphs of enrolments and it’s very satisfying to watch the numbers change over time. The paper also touches on several areas which have the potential to be optimised for female engagement; from course selection (and forming a more coherent cohort within a single faculty), to role models (the more the merrier), to competition (and encouraging a lack of it). It also has a variety of suggestions for improvement and enrichment within a CS context. 

Just look at the breadth of issues addressed:
> We have focused our effort on increasing the number of women enrolled in computer science, as opposed to the percentage. 

> We have redesigned the introductory sequence to make it accessible to a much wider audience. 

> We have sought to provide role models for undergraduate women at every level of the educational process, including those who are only one or two years more advanced in age and experience. 

> We have established several bridge programs that target students, both women and minorities, who are at greater risk of leaving technical fields.

> We have instituted a program to engage undergraduates in faculty research.

This paper was also the first I come across to mention “stepping stone” role models, which I increasingly see as being integral to engagement in CS fields. I know that I have personally changed enormously, both in interests and ways of thinking, since I began CS and can definitely see how too large a gap can be daunting rather than supporting in the wrong contexts.

**Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience - Lenore Blum**

Similar to the Stanford paper above, this paper explains the procedures put in place as Carnegie Mellon University in order to increase female enrolment in CS, from 7% in 1995 to around 40% in 2000! Talk about a concerted effort. This paper is full of delicious raw data as well as explaining the changes in these in the context of initiatives undertaken and their expected payoff times. It’s heartening to see that the initiatives undertaken at both Stanford and Carnegie Mellon are similar in character and yield similar (positive) results. The quotes from then-current students was a nice touch, also.

**Cultural stereotypes as gatekeepers: increasing girls’ interest in computer science and engineering by diversifying stereotypes - Sapna Cheryan, Allison Master and Andrew Meltzoff**

This paper looks at the issue of underrepresentation of women in CS through a psychology, rather than a engineering lens (differing from the other papers in this list). “We begin by differentiating stereotypes about the culture from the large body of useful work on stereotype threat. Then, we describe the content of students’ stereotypes about the culture of computer science and engineering and document their pervasiveness in the minds of American students. Third, we describe three ways that these stereotypes about the culture are transmitted: through environments, the media, and the people in the fields, and why these stereotypes are a more powerful deterrent for girls than boys. Fourth, we present empirical evidence that these stereotypes cause gender disparities in interest in entering computer science and engineering not only in college but earlier in the pipeline, including among high-school students. Finally, we show that these stereotypes, while powerful, are nonetheless highly malleable and that changing them encourages girls and women to enter these fields (without dissuading boys and men).”

As seen in the extract above, this paper looks broadly at the wider societal issues that affect women's’ decisions to enter (or not enter, as the case may be), CS. I found this anthropological bent on the issue to be both profoundly interesting and refreshing; there are statistics, quotes and references to popular culture. Race is mentioned as a related factor, which is conspicuously absent in many other papers on the topic. Concrete suggestions for improvement are made, as well as more hypothetical statements. I’d thoroughly encourage reading.

**When do Female Role Models Benefit Women? The Importance of Differentiating Recruitment From Retention in STEM. - Benjamin J. Drury, John Oliver Siy, and Sapna Cheryan**

This article was an unexpected find, with an unexpected conclusion. Namely, the researchers conclude that “For women who have already chosen the field, exposure to female role models protects performance…  and improves their implicit STEM self-concepts. However, interventions designed to address stereotype threat, such as deploying female role models, may not most effectively address the concerns of women not yet in STEM (i.e., those we hope to recruit into this domain). Given the limited number of women in these fields, it may be most useful to concentrate their efforts on the retention of other women while encouraging more men in STEM to serve as role models for potential female recruits.”

I was really pleased that it encouraged men to engage in becoming role models for women, as well as men, interested in STEM (something that I feel is often overlooked, for fear that it will drive women away). The differentiation between recruitment and retention was another thing that I haven't seen in many papers, but provides an important crux to differentiate the needs of different groups of women, and thus partition resources more optimally. Definitely a paper I’ll be bringing up if someone suggests that men can’t be involved in encouraging women to CS!

**Conclusion**

As you’ve probably gathered from the above, there are issues in CS that make women want to run away screaming, but there are also solutions available, tested, and ready for implementation. Here’s hoping that 20 years down the track, things will be looking better (I’ll settle for female enrolment in first year comp to be hovering at 40%).
