I recently was invited to attend a retreat, which promised to be a fun and interesting event then thoroughly failed to deliver on those promises. It was an opportunity I had “won”, through virtue of the fact I am a woman in engineering who sometimes does things to make other women in engineering feel less awful about how underrepresented we are; this meant I went in thinking it would be some form of leadership development workshop, or some form of skills development workshop.

Alas, it was not to be.

[Heads up that this post is a rant about how annoyed this retreat made me, read at your own peril]

Day one began with me holding a girl's hair as she threw up, which wasn't really how I was expecting things to go. 

After breakfast, we had a couple of tech talks, that I was looking forward to; unfortunately one of them contained no tech, and the next contained far too much html for my tastes. It was also, apparently, an updated version of a talk that's normally presented at recruiting sessions at universities which was the most obvious admittance that this retreat was a recruitment event I heard during the time I was in attendance. (Our tech talk the next day focused on design (of chairs!?), rather than computing, continuing the trend of tech talks without much, if any tech).

We then built towers out of spaghetti, tape, and marshmallows which felt more like craft time in kindergarten than something a combination of adult students should be doing (apparently there was a moral there about rapid prototyping, alas we were out of time and didn't get to hear it). Overall it was rather demeaning when they started talking about how much five year olds liked this activity.

A particularly disappointing element of this retreat was the women at $company panel. I was hoping to see some strong role models, people I could talk to and ask to come and inspire students at my university. Instead I felt as if I was at a political event, watching a ser Unfortunately, the group of women assembled resembled each other strongly, and didn't seem to have much to say. The prepared questions ranged from “How did you get into tech?” to “What’s your favourite thing about $company?” which was, on the whole, uninspiring. When one of the retreat attendees brought up a problem she was having at her university and asked for advice, there was a lot of ahh-ing and little actual advice. Knowing several outspoken, engaged women at $company, I was thoroughly disappointed in the choices made.

After this harrowing experience, we returned to kindergarten with CS Unplugged. For those of you who don’t know of CS unplugged, it’s a program developed in NZ and aimed at students in years 3-6. The goal is to teach the core concepts of computer science without the messiness that comes from writing code (As the quote (not) from Dijkstra goes: “Computer science is about computers in the same way astronomy is about telescopes”). Overall, I think it’s a great initiative, though I question the value of getting women who have been functioning within computer science for some time to do the program. Potentially there was another moral to the story here, but unfortunately we (again) ran out of time and it wasn’t shared with the class. Alas.

to finish the day, we had a healthy, Jungian, session of self analysis. I had never heard of the colour classification of personalities before, and was underwhelmed by the reality of it. It seems a pared down variant of the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator mechanism of classification, and felt very two dimensional. We were assigned to write down positive and negative aspects of our colour plus \*exciting\* assign ourselves a symbol. Umm.

Naturally, once that session ended, the symbol we chose and the colour we were assigned wasn’t touched on again.

I have this theory about boat cruises; I think that companies like them because once you commit, once you’re on the boat, you’re stuck with no way to escape. This can be particularly problematic if you’re sea sick or unwell, or even if you really hate people. 

Naturally, on the first night, we had a boat cruise.

As far as boat cruises go, I’ve been on ones that were far worse. It had been storming that day, so it was a bit windy and damp (and it started raining at one point), and the music was relentlessly Taylor Swift, but I escaped to the other end of the boat and chatted with people for the evening.

Day two began in a slightly more organised fashion (after it was realised that one attendee had vanished on an airplane overnight). We started the day with an interview and resume workshop, which was surprisingly well put together given the catastrophe of the previous day. For the interview practice, I was paired with a woman who was non technical, so rather than working through the practice problem we talked about good resources to increase generalised knowledge in the computing field (I recommended Jeremy Kubica’s works as they're both entertaining and educational, as well as the New Turing Omnibus and a couple of textbooks that she asked about. CLRS was on that list, of course). 

The resume workshop was similarly solid, although I disagreed with the proposed structure of study -> work -> other; I would strongly argue that relevant work is more important than university degree, especially for people who have been working for some time, but I digress.

My only comment on this session was that it felt very geared towards undergraduate students, and a third of the cohort were postgraduates. Hopefully they were able to take something from it.

The most interesting element, I felt, of this retreat was the Bias Busting talk. $company has an in-house diversity manager, who seems both highly competent and a good public speaker. The talk was on unconscious bias: how to identify it and the importance of doing just that. It was nothing revolutionary, but it was presented very well and was a vast improvement on the activities we were forced through the day before.

After an abortive attempt at getting us to sightsee (another storm had rolled in and the rain was intermittent but heavy), we had the final event of the retreat; the Girl Geek dinner. Apparently these dinners are a recurring event, and this particular one attracted a crowd of around 100 women in tech. We had another talk by the diversity manager, on stereotypes and their impact on performance; I came away with a couple of ideas about how to better implement plans in future workshops which was a plus. I was entirely socialed-out by this point, unfortunately, so exited stage left as soon as I was able. I was very glad to get home.

Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed in this retreat. There were definitely high points; the resume workshop was useful, as was the bias talk. Despite this, it felt like this retreat had been composed of a variety of pre-existing elements smushed together, with the organisers hoping we didn't pry too closely lest we see the cracks. There was no coherent “story” (developing leadership skills, perhaps, or working together on a single project) and this made it difficult to understand the purpose of the individual components, which were often not explained to boot. Unless there are substantial changes, I am wary of attending another such event if given the chance.
