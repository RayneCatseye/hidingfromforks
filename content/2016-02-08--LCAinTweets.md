This past week, I've been having a fantastic time not being at work, and playing at being a sponge to absorb as much information as possible at LCA2016. 

[talk about what LCA is]

At LCA, I made an attempt at live tweeting some of the events I went to (which was actually more fun than I thought!). I didn't think to do it for the first two days, so this "article" focuses disproportionately on the last two days. Oops? 

Thus, in lieu of giving you any real content, have some little sound bites, with associated talk links. Happy browsing!
