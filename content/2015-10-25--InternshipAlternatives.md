Spring is here, spring is here. Life is skittles and life is beer. Summer is approaching fast, and with it the dreaded time known as “THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS”. Now, it’s not that I don't like the summer (okay, I don't like the summer), it’s just that it’s hot and bright and generally unpleasant. I like to ignore the existence of the summer holidays, and throw myself into a haze of work; and am lucky enough to have obtained an internship wherein I can make things explode then look contrite.

But are internships the only productive, valuable, and (dare I say it) resume-building ways to spend your break away from the summer? Of course not. There are some really great and totally worthwhile alternatives that will both keep you busy, and maybe even teach you a thing or two. 

**1. Work on Open Source Projects**

Open source projects are always flush with bugs that need fixing, or features that need adding. The breadth of open source projects means that there’s something for everyone, and plenty of work to go around.

Pick something that you’re interested in (perhaps a program that you use a lot), in an area you have some knowledge in and go for it. You’ll gain experience working with large codebases (a skill that you often only pick up in the workplace), and undoubtedly learn more about several areas of coding along the way. Plus, that program you like will work better and have more features at the end of it.

**2. Take some online (or real life) courses**

UNSW runs courses over the holidays, as do a bunch of other online sites (I’m looking at you Coursera). Picking an interesting course to take in summer will keep you sharp over the hols, and can even contribute to your degree if you take it with your home institution.

On the home front, first year maths and comp courses run over the holidays, as to a variety of gen-eds. Some gen-ed courses are only a month long, too, if you want that component over and done with!

With regards to the internet, Coursera has options for courses in Data Science, Algorithm Design, Languages etc. They're all there, ready to go, and the holidays are your best time to get on them. Combine this with option 4 below for a double-strike straight to the resume. (It’s perfectly acceptable to put online courses on your resume, especially if you did well in them.)

**3. Volunteer in the field**

Volunteering is often underlooked, but is absolutely a valuable pastime when you have the time to spend on it. Employers look upon it positively, you learn new (and hopefully relevant skills), plus you get to meet new people. Reasons galore to hop on it.

Perhaps you know someone whose business is struggling with the tech side of things, or perhaps there’s a not-for-profit who’s looking for someone to help out with tech things. Both situations give you a chance to hone your skills, and an environment that encourages you to do it. Plus, because you’re doing it for free there’s less pressure and more room for experimentation. If you volunteer through the uni, then it can go on your AHEGS statement, too.

We’re always told that the best way to learn is to teach, so why not put that into practice? Tutoring programs and camps are a big deal over the holidays, and there are many positions available for tutors to help teach kids how to code. If you’re wanting to get a paid tutoring position later on, this helps you practice for that as well!

**4. Put together a project of your own**

As they say, if the opportunity doesn’t come to you then you make your own. Work with a group of friends (or without them), and put an idea together. Always wanted to create a website, build an app, or revolutionise a field? No homework and lots of free time is an ideal start situation!

**Conclusion**

There are so many things to do over the summer that don't involve the sun, or the outdoors, and I'd thoroughly recommend them all. Whether you choose to intern, volunteer, study of develop something totally new, have a fun time and watch out for the sunburn that's sure to come. See you all next winter!
