One thing I see a fair amount in tech is a sort of myopia; focusing on the purely technical at the expense of broader reading. As well as this, there is enough breadth of expected knowledge in tech that it becomes difficult for newcomers to work out what information they should know, and where to get it. Beyond XKCD, books like Cryptonomicon are a mainstay of tech culture, and concepts like finite automata and Turing machines aren't introduced until further years, but crop up in the strangest of places. There isn't a course that can cover these concepts meaningfully off the bat, but books can be an efficient substitute. I've tried to compile a list that covers scifi/fantasy, tech history, as well as computational theory. I also included Godel Escher Bach because I'm a horrible person.

In an attempt to remedy both of these issues, I have been working on creating a "Summer Reading Program" at my university, the contents of which I thought I'd share with you all as well. Ideally, a contestant would read 4 or more books over the summer period, and receive the currency of the tech world; a commemorative tshirt.

**Book List (in no particular order):**
1. *Computational Fairy Tales* by Jeremy Kubica. - A romp through the principles of computational thinking, illustrating high-level computer science concepts, the motivation behind them, and their application via the medium of a fairy tale. "Bonkers, but very enjoyable."

2. *Cryptonomicon* by Neal Stephenson. - Somewhere between WWII and the modern day lies the truth. Not for the faint of heart, this book teaches cryptography, history and interpersonal relations on the backdrop of war, business and politics. “War and Peace for nerds.”

3. *The Codebreakers* by David Kahn. - Codes have been around since the time of the Pharaohs, and ways to crack those codes just as long. This book looks at both sides of these stories, over 3000 years. “The volume is an anthology of a hundred detective stories, one more ingenious than the last, and all real, central to the fate of armies and kingdoms”

4. *Little Brother* by Cory Doctorow. - What do you value more -- security or privacy? An in depth look at the perils of a police state, with education about secure systems and crypto thrown in. Highly readable. “It's not about doing something shameful. It's about doing something private. It's about your life belonging to you.”

5. *Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origin of the Internet* by Katie Hafner. - Twenty five years ago it didn't exist. Now its the backbone of our society.This book chronicles the stories of the pioneers responsible for the best invention since the telephone. “Various nerds in the U.S. and U.K. created the technology behind what we now call the internet”

6. *Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing* by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher. -  Read this book if you are a woman in computer science. Read this book if you're a man in computer science. Read it if you've poked computer science, once, with a stick. Highly important to understanding the state of things in our field."Women must know more than how to use technology; they must know how to design and create it."

7. *The Peripheral* by William Gibson. - 3D printing, drones, and time travel. What’s not to like? "Spectacular, a piece of trenchant, far-future speculation”

8. *New Turing Omnibus : 66 Excursions in Computer Science* by A.K. Dewdney. - As it says on the tin; 66 excursions into computer science running the gamut from finite automata to the Mandelbrot set to the limits of computability. If you’ve ever wanted to understand algorithms by way of enchiladas, this book is for you. “A useful book of worthwhile diversions”

9. *The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood* by James Gleick. - A chronicle and reflection on how information has become the blood, fuel and vital principle of our society. Cinematic in tone, an engaging introduction to information theory.

10. *The Cuckoo’s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage* by Clifford Stoll. - Before the internet became a global tool, and the NSA began spying on us all, the KGB weren't much better. This story follows an astronomer at Berkeley University who looks into a 75c discrepancy in accounting and finds something he didn't bargain for. “Cybercrime circa 1989”

11. *The Eyre Affair* by Jasper Fforde. - Welcome to Great Britain, 1985, where time travel is routine, cloning is a reality and literature is taken very, very seriously. A favourite of Richard Buckland’s and referenced often in his lectures.

12. *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* by Eliezer Yudkowsky - Replace Harry Potter with Artemis Fowl, in a much darker, and more realistic, world than Rowling imagined. Teaches logic and rationality in an amusing (though sometimes contrived) way; with requisite plans for world domination woven throughout. Recommended if you liked the sequences in Less Wrong.

13. *Book of the New Sun* by Gene Wolfe. - A million years from now, when our present culture is no longer a memory, the sun is dying. The narrator is a torturer and liar, searching for a new life. “Science fiction’s Ulysses”

14. *The Art of UNIX Programming* by Eric Raymond. - Three decades of wisdom through the medium of philosophy, design patterns, tools, culture, and traditions that shape UNIX (and software everywhere). A surprisingly fun read.

And now for the really challenging ones. Fair warning that these books are prone to inducing an unfortunate sensation of your brain melting (but they're fantastically good once you accept your brain will never be solid again):

15. *Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* by Douglas Hofstadter. - If anybody tells you that they understand what this book is about, chances are theyre lying. It’s absolutely fantastic though. Read this book if you like to think about thinking, as well as to think about thinking about thinking. Then thinking about that. "Well, it’s certainly ... something! Yes, quite a wonderful something indeed."

16. *Quantum Computing Since Democritus* by Scott Aaronson. - A tour of mathematics, computer science and physics -- via philosophy. Not for the mathematically lazy. "You can't actually build a working computer whose radius is more than 20 billion light years or whatever. It's depressing, but true."

And there we have it! Think my taste in books is atrocious? Think I should have added another book? Let me know! I'm always interested in new reading materials.
