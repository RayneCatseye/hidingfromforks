Title: I Came, I Saw, I Experienced IT

In October 2015 I ran a workshop as part of Experience It!, covering the computer science element of engineering. It was a very interesting day, though absolutely not what I expected it would be. Here’s my take on what I learnt from the workshop, catastrophes and all.

**What is "Experience It!"?**

Let’s start with some context: Experience It! Is an engineering day for girls in years 9-12 including both workshops and talks. As the website exclaims: "Come along to join other interested girls in hands-on workshops, career talks and Q&A sessions, run by staff and students from multiple universities and industry partners. Together we will explore the many opportunities that engineering offers, and you can see what interests you most."

I ran a workshop (computing), and the program itself is run by Engineers Australia. Due to its generic name it's very difficult to search for information on it on the internet, unfortunately. 

**Planning Stages**

When I was first asked to lead a workshop, I forgot to ask for such useful information as resources and time, thus planned for a full day workshop with computers. This full day workshop was going to include teaching some general concepts in computer science, followed by Python, and then Markov Chains.

I picked Markov Chains because there are some fun things that can be done with them. Specifically, I wanted to capitalise on the fact One Direction are on hiatus, and get the girls to “make new 1D songs, since they can’t seem to do it themselves”. There are also lots of markov bots on the internet already; a variety of fantastic twitter bots, whatWouldISay for facebook etc, which add a social element to the teaching. Finally, the basic concepts behind Markov Chains aren't too difficult, and are almost infinitely customisable, meaning the students could stretch themselves as much as they felt comfortable.

The general idea behind this overarching plan was thus: I feel that one of the barriers for entry for women in computer science is not being able to see where it will take them; I hoped to show them that there were many places they could end up, in many different fields, doing many different things.

Alas, it was not to be. 

Upon emailing the organisers for confirmation, I was told that the workshop was only an hour (uh oh). Then I was told that the girls would be broken into groups, and the whole day would be a competition (aaah!). This clashed absolutely with what I had planned, and a dramatic rethink was in order.

**The Final Countdown**

I was still keen to show the students that computer science had a variety of uses they may not have come across, and was still keen to show them that programming itself isnt scary (I am totally for teaching younger students Python, as it consistently surprises me with how intuitive it is). However, the time constraints were problematic.

After brainstorming with a friend who has extensive experience tutoring, we came to the conclusion that sentiment analysis would be a good problem to have the girls tackle; it’s base problem is small and simple, and it’s highly customisable. We pared down the original plan, throwing out the overview of computer science, cutting back the Python overview to the basics, and giving the students a base plan to work from. We decided that points would be awarded based on complexity and reach of additions to the base plan, and the students would work in groups on a single piece of code. The group work also had an added bonus of helping smooth discrepancies in programming skills to make the problem more fair.

With all that under my belt, notes printed and text files ready to go, I was prepared to face the day.

**Sink or Swim**

Naturally, the day went very differently to the plan that I’d laid out. The biggest change was that the computers we were assured would work, didn't. At all. For almost the entire time that we needed them for. Then of course, the interface that I wanted the students to work with refused to function (but only in some cases, my favourite kind of bug), too. 

Admittedly, I didn't deal with this as well as I could have. Rather than getting the students to work through the questions in the booklet, I asked them to read through it and chat amongst themselves. Naturally, there was more chatting than there was reading.

I don't know if the students got anything out of my workshop at all, which is the most frustrating thing for me. I was prepared to handle students not knowing Python, prepared for them to try and do strange things with code. What I wasn't prepared for was a technical malfunction, which is almost hilarious in retrospect.

**Hindsight and all That**

So what have I learnt? Don't try to teach computing on computers, especially as a once off. As soon as technology is brought into the mix, there are too many variables and too much can go wrong. If asked to undertake something like this in the future, I would absolutely lean towards teaching something which required at most pen and paper (they’re easier to provide than computers). 

In terms of concrete things to work from, [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/) does some really cool stuff that I think can be adapted for an older audience, and it would probably work better to show the variety of applications that computer science has (as there’s less technical stuff for the kids to absorb, there’s far more variety to be covered).

Trying to be too smart, and to overengineer solutions is always my downfall. Maybe this time I'll actually learn the lesson.
